PARALLAX SCROLL
======

Pure CSS parallax scroll effect. Inspired by 
[ESPN's article on Luis Suarez](http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/10984370/portrait-serial-winner-luis-suarez-soccer-most-beautiful-player).

Different from most parallax effects due to its lack of JavaScript.

  I find you lack of JS comforting
